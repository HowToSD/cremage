Welcome to Cremage.

Cremage is designed with the following goals in mind:

1. Make it easy to generate images even if you are not familiar with AI.
2. Make it easy for a power user for tweak new images as well as previously generated images.

For example, if you are starting out with AI image generation, you can just enter positive prompt and press the Generate button to create images without tweaking any options.

You can also go back to any of the previously generated image and tweak as Cremage provides the same image editing capability irrespective of whether it's newly generated or images generated months ago.

# High quality face generation
Cremage offers face fix capability which was pioneered by Adetailer for Automatic1111. Cremage allows you to improve face during and after image generation, resulting in high quality face images.

In addition, with fully integrated IP-Adapter-FaceID, you can generate consistent face across multiple images.

# Installation
Refer to [Installation Guide](docs/installation_guide.md "View the Installation Guide")

# User's guide
Cremage is designed to make it intuitive to use, but there are still things that are not obvious.  I recommend you have a quick look at [User's Guide](docs/users_guide.md "View the User's Guide")

# Non-commercial use
Cremage is initially released for non-commercial research purpose only, but this is subject to change.  If you are interested in using it commercially, please contact me at support@candee.ai.

# Reporting bugs
The best way to report a bug is to create an issue on github.

I hope you will enjoy generating artwork!

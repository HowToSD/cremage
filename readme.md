Welcome to Cremage.

Cremage is designed with the following goals in mind:

1. Make it easy to generate images even if you are not familiar with AI.
2. Make it easy for a power user for tweak new images as well as previously generated images.

For example, if you are starting out with AI image generation, you can just enter positive prompt and press the Generate button to create images without tweaking any options.

You can also go back to any of the previously generated image and tweak as Cremage provides the same image editing capability irrespective of whether it's newly generated or images generated months ago.

# High quality face generation
## Bad face fix
Even using a high-quality fine-tuned model, Stable Diffusion can still generate bad face when the size of the face is relatively small. Cremage offers face fix capability which is inpired by a feature pioneered by Adetailer for Automatic1111. Cremage allows you to improve face during and after image generation, resulting in high quality face images.

## Consistent face generation
In addition, with fully integrated IP-Adapter-FaceID, you can effortlessly generate the face of a same person consistently across multiple images. This feature is designed to be easy to use and all you have to do is specifying the a source face image and the desired prompt.

## Not Suitable for Minors or Those Sensitive to Potentially Offensive Content

While **Stable Diffusion** is a powerful and versatile tool for image creation, it has the potential to generate content that may be inappropriate for minors. Additionally, **Stable Diffusion** can occasionally produce images that some users might find offensive.

The **Cremage** software includes a feature designed to filter out sensitive content; however, this filter is not foolproof and may not effectively screen all such content. As a result, **Cremage** is not suitable for use by minors.

By choosing to use **Cremage**, users acknowledge and accept the risks associated with potential exposure to inappropriate or offensive content.

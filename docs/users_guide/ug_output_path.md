# Where is the output directory for images?

Images are generated under .cremage/outputs your home directory. You can also select File | View output directory from the menu to display this directory using your OS file viewer.

Similarly, images that you deleted on the image list box are moved to .cremage/trash so that you can restore files from there if you want.  It is recommended that you empty this directory using your OS file viewer if you really want to delete the images.
